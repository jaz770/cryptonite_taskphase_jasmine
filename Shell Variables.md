# Shell Variables

## Printing Variables 
The value stored in the variable `FLAG` has to be printed to get the flag.   
`echo` prints what the user passes as the argument so it cannot directly print the value of a variable.   
`$` is prepended to the variable name to print the value.  
The command is: `echo $FLAG`  

flag: `pwn.college{0ouh0bdgmmOnsYxuKbQv6OC68fK.ddTN1QDL4ATO0czW}`

## Setting Variables  
In this challenge, the value `COLLEGE` must be assigned to the variable `PWN` to get the flag.  
This is done with `=`.  
>[! NOTE]
>There must be NO spaces before or after the =.
The command is: `PWN=COLLEGE`

flag: `pwn.college{swWvPphayISppgGLmKS4-aGNVrO.dlTN1QDL4ATO0czW}`
