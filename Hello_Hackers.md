# Hello Hackers
The first module in the Linux Luminarium. Teaches the basics of interacting with the command line. The first challenge teaches how to enter commands and the second challenge introduces commands with arguments. 
## Intro to Commands
A command entered in the terminal will give an output based on the requirements. 
For example, the `whoami` command prints the username to the terminal.  
In the challenge, the hello command will give the flag.  
First ssh into the challenge screen. The `hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$` prompt will appear.   
Enter the `hello` command and you will get the flag.     

flag: `pwn.college{UAkLJB0LNdVjbGaHD7r9VLfEqWd.ddjNyUDL4ATO0czW}`

## Intro to Arguments
This challenge introduces commands with arguments.  
You have to execute the `hello` command with the argument `hackers`. So `hello hackers` is the exact command that needs to be entered.     
Ssh into the challenge screen. The corresponding prompt will appear.  
Enter `hello hackers` to get the flag.    
flag:  `pwn.college{0A2LzhCKzvisRryp3B3SLkIs85_.dhjNyUDL4ATO0czW}`
